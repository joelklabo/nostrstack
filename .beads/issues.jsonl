Fetch user's contact list (kind 3 event) on login\n2. Store follow list in state (already partially done in useMuteList pattern)\n3. Add toggle button in FeedView header: 'All' / 'Following'\n4.

This is THE core social feature.\n2. **Terrible DM UX** - DM list shows only hex pubkeys, no profile names/avatars/previews. Users can't identify conversations.\n3. **No thread/conversation view** - Posts are flat. Clicking reply opens a modal but doesn't show thread context or nested replies.\n\n## Impact\n- Users can't follow the social graph (defeats purpose of social network)\n- DMs are unusable for real communication\n- Conversations are fragmented and hard to follow\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Following feed filter with toggle\n- [ ] DM list shows profile names, avatars, and last message preview\n- [ ] Thread view shows full conversation context with nested replies","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-05T22:23:35.380789365-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-05T22:23:35.380789365-08:00","created_by":"klabo"}

Makes debugging hard and introduces silent failures.\n2. **No pre-commit hooks or local validation** - Developers discover lint/type failures in CI (10+ min feedback loop) instead of locally.\n3. **Monolithic embed package** - 2,400 LOC single file with closure state hell, magic numbers, and potential memory leaks. Hard to maintain and test.\n\n## Impact\n- New contributors get confused by scattered docs and lack of setup validation\n- Type safety gaps in embed allow runtime bugs that slip past TypeScript\n- CI feedback loop too slow; devs push broken code that fails in CI\n\n## Success Criteria\n- [ ] Zero @ts-ignore in packages (replace with proper types)\n- [ ] Pre-commit hooks catch lint/type issues locally\n- [ ] Embed package split into testable modules with 80%+ coverage\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2026-01-05T22:22:14.101190266-08:00","updated_at":"2026-01-05T22:22:14.101190266-08:00","created_by":"klabo"}

Create ThreadView component\n2. When post clicked, fetch parent chain (follow 'e' tags with 'reply' marker up to root)\n3. Fetch all replies (events with 'e' tag pointing to this event)\n4. Display as nested tree with indentation (max depth 5, already in code)\n5.
